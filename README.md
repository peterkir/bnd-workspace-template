## Template Fragments

When bndtools creates a new workspace, it will allow the user to check a number of _template fragments_. A template fragment is a folder somewher (either Github or addressed via a URL) with instsructions how to apply the content to a workspace. The [index.bnd](index.bnd) in this repository is the master file that is included by default by bndtools. We accept PRs for this file if you want to add your own templates. In this repository we manage a number of useful fragments like gradle, OSGi R8, common maven like setup, etc.
